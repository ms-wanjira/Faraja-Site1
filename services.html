					<h2>We Can Help You With These Situations:</h2>

			</div>
			<!-- <div class="container-fluid px-0"> -->
			<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Alchohol Addiction</h2>
			<p>
				Do you worry that your drinking is becoming a little bit too much?
			</p>
			<p>
				Are you losing control of your drinking habits?
			</p>
			<p>
				Alcohol use and dependency is on the rise in Kenya due to unhealthy drinking habits, easy access to
				alcohol and lack of information on the dangers of excessive drinking.
			</p>
			<p>
				Faraja Fountain offers effective Evidence Based and affordable counselling services for people with
				alcohol dependency. We understand that clients are unique hence, offer individualized treatment to suit
				our client's situations and needs. We offer both traditional one on one counseling and e-therapy
				sessions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through screening and assessment, our qualified addiction will advise you on the kind of treatment which
				suits you or your loved one best. Some clients may require a more intensive level of care, while others
				may have other co-occurring disorders, and in this case, we will be able to refer appropriately.

			</p>
			<p>
				How do you know that you need help?
			</p>
			<p>
				Alcohol use passes several stages before it becomes problematic. Alcohol dependence is characterized by
				a strong, often uncontrollable desire to use. The more accustomed the body becomes to the effects of
				alcohol, the more the tolerance grows and the more you have to increase the use more than before to
				experience the same 'high' as before. Tolerance often results in physical dependence on the substance,
				which can develop into alcohol addiction.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you become dependent on alcohol, even though you may not realize that your drinking is out of
				control, drinking becomes your priority and the more you seek opportunities to drink more than anything
				else, including family, friendships and work. This is usually unintentional but can be misconstrued as
				lack of care for loved ones and alcohol takes over your life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Alcohol can be a coping mechanism for other deeper issues because it provides a “relief” from the
				underlying issues but unfortunately it only makes things worse and the problems can quickly spiral to
				uncontrollable levels.

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Drug Addiction and Prevention</h2>
			<p>
				Do you Know the signs of drug addiction?
			</p>
			<p>
				Where does the line between use and abuse lie?
			</p>
			<p>
				What qualifies as drug addiction?
			</p>
			<p>
				Drug addiction is a severe problem affecting thousands of people across all age groups social
				backgrounds in Kenya. Addiction is a chronic incurable disease, but it can be managed.

			</p>
			<p>
				Addiction carries a lot of stigma and stereotyping due to lack of understanding and plenty of people
				think that alcohol and drug use is a matter of choice and will power. Contrary to that common belief
				that addiction is a chronic condition and if not properly managed it can get worse with time and the
				person loses their power of choice and can no longer control their consumption or use.

			</p>
			<p>
				The number of people with active substance use disorder is very high in Kenya and includes people using
				a variety of substances. Some of the commonly abused substances in kenya includes but not limited to:

				<li>Marijuana</li>
				<li>Prescription Drugs</li>
				<li>Khat(Miraa)</li>
				<li>Heroine</li>
				<li>Cocaine</li>
				<li>Benzodiazepines</li>
				<li>Methamphetamines </li>

			</p>
			<p><b>Crossing the line from drug abuse to addiction</b></p>
			<p>
				There are different stages of drug use ranging from normal to problematic use. Not everyone who uses
				alcohol and/or drugs develops a substance use disorder. Some people can stop use/consumption whenever
				they want while others cannot control their use.
			</p>
			<p><b>Signs of Drugs of Addiction.</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Drinking or using greater amounts of alcohol or drugs, or drinking or using for a longer period than
					originally intended.</li>
				<li>Trying to cut back on or control alcohol or drug use, or trying to quit entirely, but not being able
					to. </li>
				<li>Spending a lot of time drinking or using drugs, or being sick as a direct result of drinking or drug
					use. </li>
				<li>Noticing signs of craving, meaning wanting a drink or a drug so badly that it crowds out all other
					thoughts. </li>
				<li> Drinking or drug use, or being sick as a result, interferes with responsibilities at home, work, or
					school.
				</li>
				<li>
					Continuing to drink or use drugs despite the problems it causes with friends or family.
				</li>
				<li>Cutting back on or giving up activities that were once important if they get in the way of drinking
					or drug use.</li>
				<li> Ending up in risky, dangerous, or life-threatening situations as a result of drinking or drug use
					(i.e. walking in a dangerous area, unsafe sex, operating machinery, driving under the influence).
				</li>
				<li>
					Continuing to drink or use drugs despite their harmful impact on physical or mental health.
				</li>
				<li>Needing to drink or use greater amounts to achieve the desired effect (developing a tolerance).
				</li>
				<li>
					Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when the effects of drugs or alcohol wear off.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				Someone who shows even 2 of these symptoms may qualify as having an alcohol or substance use disorder.
				The severity of a person's condition is determined by the number of qualifications they meet:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mild Use Disorder: 2 to 3 symptoms. </li>
				<li>Moderate Use Disorder: 4 to 5 symptoms. </li>
				<li>Severe Use Disorder: 6 or more symptoms. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>The best way to determine the presence of a substance or alcohol use disorder is to seek professional
				help from a Qualified Addiction Professional. </p>
			<p>Will drug addiction treatment actually cure drug addiction?</p>
			<p>Will the desire to drink or use drugs ever go away?</p>
			<p> Unfortunately, there isn't a cure for alcoholism or drug addiction. Addiction is a chronic, relapsing
				brain disorder similar to other conditions. There's always the possibility of relapse, and at Faraja
				Fountain we help you on how to manage your alcohol or substance use disorder so that you can live a
				productive healthy lifestyle free from drugs. </p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">School Assistance Programme</h2>
			<p> Students experience behavioral and disciplinary violations including Substance Use, our School
				Assistance Programs help students get through schools safely and successfully, and improve school
				attendance and academic performance.</p>
			<p>When students use the supportive services, it is beneficial not only to the students but also to the
				staff, family and the community. </p>
			<p> Adolescents may easily fall into peer pressure and make irrational decisions which are destructive, and
				therefore, it is critical to prevent substance abuse at its onset before they become dependent on drugs.
				Faraja fountain realizes that it is important to offer interventions even at experimental stages before
				it becomes full-blown.</p>
			<p>Drug tests/toxicology determine the substance being abused and together with the client/guardian come up
				with an individualized treatment plan for the client. </p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Adolescent Outpatient Programme</h2>
			<p>The AOP affords adolescents the opportunity to receive individual therapy that addresses several issues
				such
				as healthy peer selection, conflict resolution, decision-making and coping skills, self-esteem building,
				addressing child trauma, vocational training and involvement in self-help groups to aid in the recovery
				process.</p>


			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Family Programme</h2>
			<p>
				Family treatment is a vital component that enhances the recovery of the chemically dependent person, as
				well
				as one that promotes overall family recovery from the effects that chemical dependency has on individual
				family members
			</p>
			<p>
				Addiction is a family disease that affects all family members, as well as significant others and when a
				loved one uses drugs and alcohol, the family and all members undergo some very serious life-changing
				events.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, by tackling underlying emotional issues within their personal lives, clients and their family
				members help develop healthier, deeper and more satisfying relationships. The importance of family
				participation includes:
			<ul>
				<li>Enhancing effective communication skills among family members</li>
				<li>Treatment strategies to facilitate family healing </li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Training and Psycho-Education </h2>
			<p>Faraja Fountain recognizes that prevention and wellness training programs are key in addressing substance
				use disorders and prevention. We offer a variety of training services about substance use disorders,
				drug-free workplace education, conflict management, stress management, crisis management etc. </p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Recovery Coaching & Relapse Prevention.</h2>
			<p>
				Recovery from drug and alcohol addiction is a lifelong process, which requires a commitment to a plan of
				recovery. The leading causes of relapse are failure to have a plan of recovery or deviation from that
				plan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our relapse prevention program is designed to provide the client with an in-depth understanding of the
				triggers, daily stressors, or anxieties which can be troubling for someone in recovery. Relapse
				behaviors emerge long before the person takes the first use of the substance, it is essential that
				someone in recovery attends a relapse prevention program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recovery coaching helps in establishing healthy boundaries, assisting with development of refusal
				skills, conflict resolution, effective decision making techniques, healthy choice and dealing with urges
				or craving.
			</p>
			<p>
				“Addiction is a compulsive behavior and seeking treatment is essential so as to achieve and maintain
				your recovery/sobriety. It is essential to seek help at the very early signs /manifestations of
				addiction. Contact us to see how we can get you or your loved one back to the right path, a life with a
				purpose and free from drugs.”
			</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tele -Therapy.</h2>
			<p>Individuals with Substance Use Disorders need support wherever they are. To meet this need Faraja
				Fountain offers online counselling sessions. With secure, confidential video conferencing technology,
				you can receive support at the safety of your home. </p>
			<p>
				We offer addiction counseling and recovery coaching via online platforms. Tele-therapy allows you to
				meet with our qualified therapists and you can join a virtual counseling session using your phone,
				computer or any other device with internet access.
			</p>
